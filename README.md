# transform
Bitcoin/Ethereum/ETC/DCR/USDT/LTC/BTY/BCH/SC/ZEC private key/public key and address transformation
Actually, this project is my first time to use Golang, when I worked in a block-chain company. My boss asked me to accomlish the
transformation among private key, public key and account address of digic coin. There are 10 different kind of coins, and their
transfor function are roughly same. Coins like BCH has the same transfor function with BTC. The most difficult part is SC and DCR,
you have to figure out the theory of them then you can accomplish the transformation.
